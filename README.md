**Browse** you and your friends' iNaturalist observations with a more lightweight and accessible interface.
  Edit the iNaturalist username to load observations from other users (no login needed).

**Share** your showcase: adding your username to the URL (like `/shintoo`) will automatically load your observations

**Filters** are available too, such as filtering for plants, animals, or birds.

**Learn** about you or others' observations, with smart descriptions provided by wikipedia. Summaries from pages
of the next most specific taxon are provided if there is no wikipedia page for the observation's taxon.
