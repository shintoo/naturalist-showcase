### fun features
- Browse you and your friends' iNaturalist observations with a more lightweight interface
- Edit the iNaturalist username to load observations from your account (no login needed)
- Share your showcase: adding `/<yourusername>` to the URL will automatically load your observations
- Descriptions provided by Wikipedia, and if there is no wikipedia page for the observation's taxon,
  then the phylogenetic tree is climbed until the most local taxon with a wikipedia page is found
  (e.g. if there is no wikipedia page for the species, nor the genus, but there is for the family).
