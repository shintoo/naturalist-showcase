# Naturalist Showcase

An alternative iNaturalist observation browser, built to showcase your work.

**Browse** you and your friends' iNaturalist observations with a more lightweight and accessible interface.
  Edit the iNaturalist username to load observations from other users (no login needed)

**Share** your showcase: adding your username to the URL (like `/shintoo`) will automatically load your observations

**Learn** with descriptions provided by Wikipedia, and if there is no wikipedia page for the observation's taxon,
  then the phylogenetic tree is climbed until the most local taxon with a wikipedia page is found. That way, there
  is always a description provided! (For example, if there is no wikipedia page for the species, nor the genus, but
  there is for the family). The description will then have additional text to indicate this, e.g. "Philodinida is an order within the Bdelloidea subclass. [bdelloidea description]"
